Create user stories from this motivational model:

Name of project: {modelName}
Goal of project: {goal}
StakeHolders: {namesStakeHolder}
Epics: {namesEpic}
emotional goals: {emotionalGoals}

Let's convert it step by step.

1st: Think about the background of this model.
2nd: Consider the motivational model as a tree and to generate a user story for each leaf.
3rd: Think about the responsibilities of each stakeholder.

User stories should be following these rule:
1. As independent as possible
2. Reporting any relevant details as much as possible
3. Should provide value to end users
4. Must be able to be estimated of relative size and effort
5. Should be sufficiently granular, and not defined at a too high level
6. Must be formulated in and effort to stress useful details for creating tests

Each user stories should be organized as [As a <role> I can <capability>, so that <receive benefit with emotional goals>]

Do not list out emotional goals separately! Emotional goals should be the sentence of the user story.

Organize your answer with the following template:

Model<name> 
Epic<number>:<name>
<stakeholder>:
    <list of user stories>
