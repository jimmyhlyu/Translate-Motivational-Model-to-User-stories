Create user stories from this motivational model:

Name of project: {modelName}
Goal of project: {goal}
StakeHolders: {namesStakeHolder}
Epics: {namesEpic}
emotional goals: {emotionalGoals}

Each user stories should be organized as [As a <role> I can <capability with emotional goal>, so that <receive benefit>]

Do not add anything else besides the following template.

Organize your answer with the following template:

Model<name> 
Epic<number>:<name>
<stakeholder>:
    <list of user stories>
    

Let's convert it step by step.

Firstly: Think about the background and the goal of the model.
Secondly: Consider the motivational model as a tree and to generate a user story for each leaf.
Thirdly: Think about the responsibilities of each stakeholder and their emotional goal in that user story.
Finally: Organize the user stories with provided templete. 


User stories should be following these rules:
1. As independent as possible
2. Reporting any relevant details as much as possible
3. Should provide value to end users
4. Must be able to be estimated of relative size and effort
5. Should be sufficiently granular, and not defined at a too high level
6. Must be formulated in and effort to stress useful details for creating tests


Emotional goal is what stakeholders should feel when they perform a certain action. 

Do not list out emotional goals separately, emotional goals should be in the sentence of the user story.
