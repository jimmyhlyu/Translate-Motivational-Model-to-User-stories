Create user stories from this motivational model:

Name of project: {modelName}
Goal of project: {goal}
StakeHolders: {namesStakeHolder}
Epics: {namesEpic}
emotional goals: {emotionalGoals}

Let's convert it step by step.

1st: Think about the background of this model.
2nd: Consider the motivational model as a tree and to generate a user story for each leaf.
3rd: Think about the responsibilities of each stakeholder.

User stories should be following these rules:
1. As independent as possible
2. Reporting any relevant details as much as possible
3. Should provide value to end users
4. Must be able to be estimated of relative size and effort
5. Should be sufficiently granular, and not defined at a too high level
6. Must be formulated in and effort to stress useful details for creating tests

Each user stories should be organized as [As a <role> I can <capability with emotional goal>, so that <receive benefit>]

Emotional goal is what stakeholders should feel when they perform a certain action. 
Do not list out emotional goals separately, emotional goals should be in the sentence of the user story.


Do not add anything else besides the following template.

Organize your answer with the following template:

Model<name> 
Epic<number>:<name>
<stakeholder>:
    <list of user stories>
